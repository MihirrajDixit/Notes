### Consistent Hashing
The files are stored on the server which is the closest clockwise.

==Balanced==: 
==Smoothness==: Addition or removal of buckets

Virtual nodes for allowing balancing keys in case of failure of a node
We need to know where the virtual nodes are.


### Distributed Hashing:
arrangement of the server is a tree

the leaf nodes for a doubly linked list storing both the predecessor and successor node.

The node also knows other nodes that induces a tree structure.
