*What is precise thinking*?
Independent, sharp, balanced thinking that is based in reason, evidence and logic. The practice of proper argumentation.

*Why should we care*?
- ==Improve your own thoughts and arguments==
- helps you revise your own belief set
- makes you see the world more clearly
- ==universally applicable==

*What do we want to learn*?
==To arrive at our own, independent position, based on reason==
- analyse information
- identify key aspects of an argument
- express yourself clearly


### Arguments:
*Why should we care*?
Attempts of persuasion are everywhere and are a driving force in our society. Thus, their reasoning becomes crucial.

*Definition:*
A collection of statements of which at least one functions as a ==conclusion== and the remainder as ==premises==


*What should be the premise and the conclusion for an argument?*
1. Your own argument?
	- Conclusion: what we want to argue for
	- Premise: reason to believe in our conclusion

2. Others Argument?
	- Depends


#### Principle Of Charity:

##### While reading someones argument:
- Find the best and strongest interpretation of any argument
- Assume that every argument was written by someone rational, capable and intelligent.
- Find charitable premises and conclusions when reconstructing another's arguments.

##### While writing your own argument:
- Write as precise as if our addressee is a mean expert who loves to point out ambiguities, mistakes and inconsistencies
- Write as easy and crisp as possible 



#### Natural Language Pitfalls:
##### Ambiguity:
*Definition*: An expression is ambiguous in a context C iff there is more than one thing it could plausibly be taken to express in C.

##### Vagueness:
An expression is vague iff there are border cases for which it is just not clear what it means.


##### Rhetorics:
A question is rhetorical when it is not really intended as a question, but as an assertion.

##### Unclear Reference Class:
It can be unclear whether the sentence is true or false. Requires explicit mention of the reference class.



### Deductive Arguments:
Validity and soundness: We want arguments to be good and sound arguments are often good arguments.

#### Validity:
An argument is valid iff it is not possible for all premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.

When an argument is valid, the conclusion really follows from the premises.

*How to show that something is not valid?*
Provide a ==counterfactual== case where all the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

*How to show that something is valid?*
##### Logical Validity:
An argument is logically valid iff it is valid due to its logical structure

Formally: Let $P$ be the set of formalised premises and $c$ be the conclusion. Then $\forall p \in P \ \ (\wedge_p \rightarrow c)$ is a tautology.

Formalising an argument: The logical form of an argument

##### Analytical Validity:
An argument is analytically valid iff it is valid due to the meaning of certain terms used in the argument

This form of validity is common and formally correct but should be used with caution.


#### Soundness:
An argument is sound iff it is valid and all its premises are true. There cannot be a sound argument with a false conclusion.


*How to tell if an argument is sound?*
*How to convince others that an argument is sound?*



**What to do when writing your own arguments:**
==Soundness reasoning:==
Reasons to believe in a premise should not be part of the premise itself as it makes it only more complicated.


"Thus", "Therefore", "because" indicate conclusion and should not be part of the premise. they are removed if it indicates a soundness reasoning.

If they do not indicate a soundness reasoning then we can use an if-construction most of the time.

We do not want too many and too detailed premises. Sometimes arguments are very complicated and need many premises. In this case we use extended standard form.

When multiple phrases means the same then we should use the same phrase as we want to achieve maximal clarity
